This is a news and weather app. 
I have used node, express, and react frameworks in this project along with javascript, HTML, and CSS.   
I have also used some of the bootstrap properties. 
I have used two APIs to get the required information.
For the deployment, I have used netlify for free hosting my webpage.
The webpage is fully responsive and currently under development.
